## TAESS: A RAG and Multi-Agent LLM System for Constitutional Argument Mining and Summarization

---

Constitutional courts face severe information overload, processing dozens of multi-party filings exceeding millions of tokens per case, while current large language models (LLMs) exhibits 17-33% hallucination rates and lacks multi-document integration capabilities. This article presents TAESS (Taiwan Constitutional Court Argument Extraction and Summarization System), combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-agent LLMs for argument mining in constitutional proceedings. Analyzing 51 Taiwan Constitutional Court cases averaging 35 filings each, we demonstrate TAESS’s capacity to organize constitutional arguments through four integrated modules that map arguments to legal issues, generate traceable summaries, and verify outputs against judicial reports. The system enables both judges and litigants to systematically review massive documentation while tracking argument evolution across parties though requiring human oversight for legal reasoning, TAESS provides a scalable framework for managing judicial information overload without sacrificing decision quality, offering both a practical tool for constitutional adjudication and a replicable methodology for empirical legal research on judicial information processing.
